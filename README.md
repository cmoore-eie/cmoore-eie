All too often on large projects the reason for its inception in the first place gets lost in the layers of hierarchy, resulting in missing the goals from lack of guidance. The articles on this site will help project managers and developers to keep everything on track, looking at practices in how to develop the solution both technical and non technical.

 

I have been involved with designing and building solutions to business needs for the past 30 years. Most of this has been involved with the Insurance Industry, working in Life and Pensions, Property and Casualty, Lloyds and London Markets, and some odd off-shore companies. There were a few years in manufacturing and medical, all had the same flavour designing and building best in class solutions.

 

From the beginning I had a passion for success, this may not be my own, and in many cases it is not. In all cases it is the client that I have worked for at the time. Striving at all time to deliver solutions with passion that encompass the vision and ideals required to make the client a success. Always looking at the big picture and able to drive that vision from the beginning.

 

From my position I have seen many projects go wrong, yet have been seen as a success. Getting it right from the beginning and making sure that the vision is there and the path towards that end is followed is what drives me, and delivering the solution needed for the client to get the most out of the investment.
